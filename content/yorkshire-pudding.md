## Ingredients

- 150 g plain flour
- ½ teaspoon -salt
- 3 medium eggs
- 200 ml semi-skimmed milk
- 100 ml cold water
- 12 teaspoons olive oil

## Method

1. Preheat your oven to 220C / 200C fan / gas mark 7 / 425F. Put 1 teaspoon of olive oil into each hole of a 12 hole muffin tin (see note 1) and place the muffin tin in the oven – it will heat up as the oven heats up.
1. In a bowl, mix together the flour and salt, to ensure the salt is evenly distributed.
1. Measure out the milk and water in a measuring jug, then crack the eggs into the same jug. Whisk together with a balloon whisk (or a fork, if you don’t have a balloon whisk).
1. Pour the eggs/milk/water mixture into the flour/salt mixture slowly, whisking constantly to ensure the ingredients are well combined.
1. Pour the Yorkshire pudding batter into the jug (to make it easier to pour into the tin later).
1. Leave the batter to rest for 20 minutes (during which time your oven and muffin tin will heat to the perfect temperature.
1. Now you need to work quickly. Remove the muffin tin from the oven, fill each hole two-thirds full with batter and get the muffin tray back into the oven ASAP (DO NOT leave the oven door open while you do this or your oven will cool down too much).
1. Cook your Yorkshire puddings for 25-30 minutes or until done to your preferred level of squidgyness/crispness (20 minutes for pale gold and squidgy, 25 minutes for mid gold and crisp with a touch of squidge, 30-35 minutes for dark gold and no squidge).
1. DO NOT for any reason open the oven door for the first 20 minutes of cooking time (or they will fall flat!)
1.Remove from the oven and eat immediately (if you leave them for any length of time they will lose their crispness and deflate somewhat).

### Notes
Serve with roast beef, other roast meats or sausages.
