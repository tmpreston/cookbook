## Ingredients

- 8 slices white bread, crusts removed  (I used 10 slices for the breakfast we had + 4 eggs)
- 200 – 250 gm bacon rashers, chopped
- 1 small onion, chopped
- 225-250 gm grated cheddar cheese​
- 3 – 4 eggs
- Butter or marge​                 
- 300ml milk
- 1 teaspoon hot mustard powder dash of Worcester sauce
- Prepared Seed mustard

## Method

1. Preheat oven to 180c.  
1. Fry bacon over medium heat, adding onion once some of the bacon fat has reduced.  Cook until onion soft and bacon browned in places.
1. Make 4 (or five) sandwiches using butter/marge on both inside pieces, a thin scaping of seed mustard on one side, bacon mixture and some of the grated cheese.  Cut sandwiches into four (This can be messy but soldier on and put any of the cheesy/bacon residue into the pudding.) Pack the cut sandwiches into a pie dish.  Sprinkle any excess cheese and bacon over the sandwiches.
1. Beat the egg, milk, powdered mustard and Worcester sauce together well and pour over the sandwiches.  (Cover with cling foil and keep in fridge for 24- 36 hours if desired.) Squeeze the sandwiches a little to ensure they take up the milk mixture.
1. Bake in the centre of a preheated oven for 30 – 35 mins or until a knife inserted in the centre comes out clean.
